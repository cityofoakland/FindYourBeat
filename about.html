	    <h2 id="types">Neighborhood	Policing Plan</h2>
      <p>The	Oakland	Police	Department	is	moving	to	a	Neighborhood	Policing	Plan with	the	
city	divided	into	 five	districts,	each	commanded	by	a	captain.	The	district	captains	
will	be	the	principal	crime	fighters	in	the	Department,	each	taking	responsibility	for	
crime	in	their	respective	districts	and	each	being	held	accountable	for	designing	and	
directing	responses	and	strategies	to	counter	crime	conditions.		The	key	to	this	new
district-based structure	is	geographic	accountability for	each	captain	– and	for	their	
subordinate	lieutenants,	sergeants,	and	officers	– for	a	specific	piece	of	ground	with	
its	specific	crime	and	disorder	problems,	its	familiar	community	members, and,	to	a	
significant	degree,	its	specific	cast	of	criminal characters.	</p>
        
    

 
      <h2 id="tech">How did we make the map? (for the geeks)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>This map was built using <a href='http://jquery.com'>jQuery</a>, <a href='http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial.html'>Google Maps</a>, and <a href='http://www.google.com/fusiontables/Home/'>Google Fusion Tables</a>. The code is open source and has been redeployed from the original application built for Chicago Schools by <a href='http://opencityapps.org'>Open City </a>and is free for anyone to reuse from <a href='https://github.com/spjika/FindYourBeat'>github</a>.</li>
        <li>Our data is also open source. View and download it from our Open Data website: <a href='https://data.oaklandnet.com/Public-Safety/Oakland-Police-Districts/ykcy-5r55'>Oakland Police Areas</a>.</li>
